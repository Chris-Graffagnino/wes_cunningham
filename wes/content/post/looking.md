+++
let me describe what I'm looking for in a relationship.<!--more--> I like my anonymity. I like my autonomy. I have no time or desire to tweet or chat or youtube or golf or watch football or put my clothes up. I DO have time and desire to make songs here and there - which, honestly, works great for me. I need something to rub against. Makes the gold, golder.

What was I saying? Yes. Us.

I want to share joy and hope and love and peace. I do not want to get popular or political or preachy. The three p's. No thanks Pal!

Don't want a reality show. Don't want pics of me everywhere. Don't want a record deal, don't want to play in your back yard. ( although...$ talks!). Kidding. Kinda.

I got 'old man' opinions about everything from christian music to waiting in lines.

I don't want to hear about cool people you know. I don't care.

I got enough on my plate. I'm happy with my life. I love my family. I like working outside with my hands. I like making music in the basement. I want to spread love and hope and gratitude for life.

Good enough? Good. Don't buy anything. I would be a terrible rich person. 

Then I'd really hate myself!

Ok, now I'm just stalling because I don't want to make dinner...
