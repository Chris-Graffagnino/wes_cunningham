  <h1> Hi </h1>

  <div id=sub-header>
    June 2017 Â· 3 minute read
  </div>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>When I was young and ambitious&hellip; and naive&hellip;I somehow got a record deal with Warner Brothers records. This was something different. It was like winning the lottery. Or almost winning the lottery. I flew around a lot.
<br><br>
After a while I became very self-conscious and neurotic. And I really wanted to BE who these good people wanted me to be. But&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t sell any records. And then we all mooned Chris Issak. Also Napster came and fired all the record guys and that was it, (I did make a second record for Warners that was never released).
<br><br>
So, tried again. Moved to california. Made a couple things and drove myself to New york AND BACK following some other band&rsquo;s tour bus. Its what&rsquo;s called &lsquo;touring&rsquo; and its really hard when its just you. or me. Anyway, that was ridiculous and I didn&rsquo;t want to spend my life that way anymore. I missed the earth so much, I missed my wife. it&rsquo;s lonely out in space&hellip;
<br><br>
Moved back home to Texas. Floundered around a bit. Taught spanish. Had kids and took random jobs. Sometimes i&rsquo;d put my antenna up and write down what I heard. sometimes i&rsquo;d just open the door a little and everything would start falling on me. but, sometimes a G chord just sounded like a G chord.
<br><br>
Somewhere in there I made a movie with some friends called SIRONIA. It was a trip and I loved every minute of it. Acting was harder than I thought and really wish I could have a second shot at it. I feel like I &ldquo;get it&rdquo; now. But whatever. It was really fun to imagine something and see it created. Heady. And then the circus left. Again.
<br><br>
So, now a days&hellip;
<br><br>
I&rsquo;m in a productive period artistically. Its been a good wave. Got with some pals in nashville one day last month and made ALASKA, (same dudes as C.I. mooning days). It was a joyous experience.
<br><br>
The feeling of that day. Of these 5 little songs, has opened something up for me. a new creative energy. Don&rsquo;t know why. Or why now. Don&rsquo;t know, but I love it when its on. I kept it off for years thinking that would make me happy.
I work during the day. I do whatever. Last week me and my 12yr old built a fence for some friends of ours. I&rsquo;m rehabbing a 100 yr old house i bought for nothing because it was literally falling over. We live really simply so I don&rsquo;t need to make stupid money. Emilie&rsquo;s in school and I get to hang out with my boys a lot. And in the &ldquo;in between moments,&rdquo; (like now, my kids are all plugged in..), I make music.
I sing songs into my phone. and imagine them with new clothes on. I get lost in the cloud of a new song and that&rsquo;s a splendid feeling.
<br><br>
And I make CDs for my friends and they say they like them and then I feel sad for some reason so I write more music. It&rsquo;s like this; I played the new recordings for my 10 yr old. and I was watching his face and I was conducting the music as he sat there with head phones on and I was yelling,&ldquo;Hear this part take off?!&rdquo;, and I found myself beaming. That&rsquo;s how I want to share music. If you like it for background music, thats fine, but I don&rsquo;t relate to that.
<br><br>
Thats pretty much it. Thanks for listening to my music. I hope you feel happy and at peace when you listen to ALASKA. I mean it. I gotta go beat up some kids.
<br><br>
